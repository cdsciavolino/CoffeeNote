# Coffee Note

Ever wanted to add an event to a calendar without the hassle of finding out the start time, date, or place? Coffee Note allows you to save information in notepad format for a specific day of the month/year. For example, if you input the text “Math Homework Due” under Friday, December 4, 2015, the information will be saved to that specific day, ready to be pulled up in a notepad format whenever you select that day next.

**See for yourself!**

The top half of the screen is dedicated to a normal calendar view corresponding to the a given month. The bottom half is a notepad for the selected day. To edit this day’s notepad, simply tap to pull up the edit screen.

Simply input whatever data you’d like into the notepad and tap the text to save!
